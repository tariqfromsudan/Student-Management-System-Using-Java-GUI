# Student Management System (Java GUI + Data Structures)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Python-based student records management system that integrates **data structures and algorithms (DSA)** with a **graphical user interface (GUI)**. It enables managing student enrollment, grades, attendance, and reports, while demonstrating core computer science concepts like linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, sorting/searching, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming.

## 🚀 Features

- **Core Logic (`student_records.py`)**
  - Manage student details, subject enrollments, grades, GPA calculation, and attendance logs.
  - Implements multiple data structures:
    - Linked List for subject enrollment  
    - Stack for grade history  
    - Queue for attendance tracking  
    - Binary Search Tree for student indexing and search  
  - Includes algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search.  
  - Greedy algorithm for selecting class representatives.  
  - Dynamic Programming for timetable optimization (weighted interval scheduling).

- **GUI Application (`student_records_GUI.py`)**
  - Tkinter-based interface for easy interaction.  
  - Provides tabs for Students, Academics, Reports, and Bonus features.  
  - Add, view, and update student records through forms and buttons.  
  - Generate academic reports, optimize timetables, and select class representatives.
